the body is the slave of the mind
The Remedy Dynasty is a movement I created to awaken Africa — mentally, physically, and spiritually.

We believe one core truth: "The body is the slave of the mind."
Everything starts in the mind. If you control your mind, you control your destiny.

Through the Dynasty, I train warriors, teach leaders, and help people remember who they really are — not what the world told them to be.
We use physical training like iRobics, deep storytelling, African ancestral wisdom, and leadership principles to reprogram how people think, move, and lead.

This isn’t a trend.
It’s a 10-year mission to build something timeless — a legacy across Africa and beyond.
A dynasty of awakened minds, disciplined bodies, and fearless spirits.

My name is REYHERU11. I’m the founder, the builder, the voice behind it.
And if this message stirs something in you —
you were never meant to sleep.
